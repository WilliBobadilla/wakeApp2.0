# wake_app_2_0 (in progress) :rocket:

App to help people to alert when they are near of theis destination, thanks to the gps of the phone, you can know the distance from where you are to your destination position, so the app calculates the distance and then it checks if you are near of your destination, and when this happens, the app notifies you with an alarm.
